# Vector Embedding Examples

This document provides examples of how to convert text into float vector formats using various open source Python libraries. The examples are provided in Python 3.8.5 and assume that the libraries are installed in the same environment as the Python interpreter. The examples are provided for the following libraries:

```plain_text
Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4.
```

1. Numpy: an open source Python package for scientific computing, which provides functions that allow for vectorization of text for embedding in float vector formats. Example: 
```python
import numpy as np

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

text_vector = np.array([float(word) for word in text.split()])
```

2. Scikit-Learn: an open source Python package for machine learning that provides functions for vectorizing text and embedding it into float vector formats. Example:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
text_vector = vectorizer.fit_transform([text])
```

3. Gensim: an open source Python package for topic modeling and natural language processing that provides functions for converting text into float vector formats. Example:

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

model = Word2Vec([text.split()], min_count=1)
text_vector = model.wv[text.split()]
```

4. TensorFlow: an open source Python library for machine learning that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

text_vector = tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer().fit_on_texts([text]).texts_to_matrix([text])
```

5. Keras: an open source Python library for deep learning that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
import keras

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

text_vector = keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer().fit_on_texts([text]).texts_to_matrix([text])
```

6. FastText: an open source Python library for text representation and classification that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
import fasttext

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

model = fasttext.load_model('model.bin')
text_vector = model.get_sentence_vector(text)
```

7. Spacy: an open source Python library for natural language processing that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
import spacy

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
text_vector = nlp(text).vector
```

8. NLTK: an open source Python library for natural language processing that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
import nltk

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

text_vector = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
```

9. TextBlob: an open source Python library for text processing and sentiment analysis that provides functions for converting text into float vector formats. Example:

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

text_vector = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
```

10. GloVe: an open source Python library for vector representation of words that provides functions for embedding text in float vector formats. Example:

```python
from glove import Glove

text = "Webpack v5 comes with the latest terser-webpack-plugin out of the box. If you are using Webpack v5 or above and wish to customize the options, you will still need to install terser-webpack-plugin. Using Webpack v4, you have to install terser-webpack-plugin v4."

model = Glove(text.split())
text_vector = model.word_vectors[model.dictionary[text.split()]]
```
